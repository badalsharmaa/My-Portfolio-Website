This is a README file for my portfolio website, which I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website showcases my skills, projects and contact information. Here are some technical details about the website:

- The website consists of three main sections: Home, Projects and Contact.
- The Home section has a brief introduction about me, a navigation bar and a background image.
- The Projects section has a grid layout of cards that display the title, description and image of each project. Each card has a link to the project's GitHub repository or live demo.
- The Contact section has a form that allows visitors to send me an email. The form uses JavaScript to validate the input fields and send the data to a backend server using AJAX.
- The website is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using media queries and flexbox.
- The website uses external libraries such as Bootstrap, jQuery and Font Awesome for styling and functionality.
- The website follows web development best practices such as semantic HTML, modular CSS and modular JavaScript.
